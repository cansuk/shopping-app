### Installing

Not must but SASS used for development and built to css manually.

- SASS installation directives :arrow_down:

Install a package manager: Before installing Sass, a package manager(the most popular ones are yarn and npm) need to have installed.

<code> command: npm install -g sass </code>

Verify the installation: Once the installation is complete, verify that Sass is installed by running the following command in the terminal:
